This project provides examples of using Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK for PHP.

### Prerequisites
PHP 5.6 or higher is required.

### Running the examples
 ```
composer install
.\lib\ImagingExamples.php --clientSecret=... --clientId=... --baseUrl=...
 ```
`--clientSecret` and `--clientId` are required parameters to connect to Aspose.Imaging Cloud. They can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (free registration in Aspose Cloud is required for this).

`--baseUrl` is an optional parameter that allows running examples with custom hosted Aspose.Imaging Cloud instance.
